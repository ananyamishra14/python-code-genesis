# Job-to-Be-Done Marketplace

A revolutionary approach to freelance marketplaces where users submit problems instead of hiring freelancers directly. AI decomposes tasks, sources solutions, and manages micro-contractors.

## Project Overview

This marketplace flips the traditional freelancing model on its head. Instead of browsing through freelancer profiles and managing multiple contractors yourself, you simply submit your problem (e.g., "Get 10K legit website visitors"), and our platform does the rest.

### Key Features

- **Problem-First Approach**: Submit what you need done, not who you need to hire
- **AI Task Decomposition**: Our system breaks down complex problems into manageable micro-tasks
- **Smart Matching**: AI matches tasks with the best-qualified micro-contractors
- **Managed Execution**: The platform coordinates all contractors and ensures quality results
- **Secure Payments**: Integrated payment system with Stripe Connect and smart contracts

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (configurable for production databases)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for task decomposition and contractor matching
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Connect for secure payments
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom contract generation and management

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file with Flask routes and core functionality
- `models.py`: Database models and schema
- `ai_utils.py`: AI-related functions for task decomposition and matching
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface
- `static/`: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)

## How It Works

1. **Client Submits Problem**: The client describes what they need done, sets a budget and timeline
2. **AI Decomposition**: The system breaks down the problem into specific tasks
3. **Task Matching**: Tasks are matched with qualified contractors
4. **Execution**: Contractors complete tasks under AI coordination
5. **Quality Control**: Results are verified against success criteria
6. **Payment**: Secure payment is released to contractors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Stripe API keys

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-to-be-done-marketplace.git
   cd job-to-be-done-marketplace
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables
   ```
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
